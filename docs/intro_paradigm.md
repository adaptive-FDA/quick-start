# The paradigme of Functional Data Analysis

Functional Data Analysis (FDA) refers to the case where the observation units are whole curves (also called trajectories or sample paths). Then the data set consists of a collection of N trajectories corresponding to N observation units, modeled by the same underlying stochastic process defined on
some domain.
